        <h1>Meet Mahsa: A Little About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Mahsa Rasouli. I currently live in Herat, Afghanistan, and<br> i am the process of learning various skills. I have finished school, but due to the<br> current situation in Afghanistan after the return of the Taliban, I have not been<br> able to start university. Right now, I am studying Web design. And i am learning<br> fashion design. I have also studied English up to Advanced level, and it has helped<br> me alot in my learning journey. </p>
    <p>I have many interests that bring joy to my everyday life. I absolutely love cats, and i<br> enjoy trying new foods whenever i get the chance. I'm also passionate about traveling, <br>shopping, listening to music, spending time with friends, and reading books. One of<br> my biggest passions is the world of fashion, especially fashion design. It is one of my<br> main goals to become a successful fashion designer in the future and continue growing <br>in this creative field.</p>
